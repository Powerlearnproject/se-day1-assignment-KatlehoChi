Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Answer: Software engineering is the process of designing, building and testing software. It is important in providing a structured approach to developing reilable and efficient
software solutions.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Answer: - Project Planning: Defining the project scope, timeline, budget application 
        - Design Completion: Finalizing the software acrhitecture, user interface
        - Requirement gathering: Indentifing and documenting the specific needs and goal of project shareholders


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Answer: - Planning: Involes determining the project's requirements and goals.
        - Analyisis: Involves analyizing the project requirements. 
        - Design: Involves designing the products achitecture. 
        - Development: Involves building and coding the software.
        - Testing: Involves testing the softeware to ensure ut meets customer expectations.
        - Implementation: Involves puuting the software to use.
        - Maintenanace: involves maintaing and improving the software.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Answer: -Waterfall methodologies are applicable to projects where the requirement are well-defined, claerand unlikely to change.
        -Agile methodologies are applicable in projects that need flexibility, frequent adaptation to changing needs and a collaborative approach.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Answer: - Software Developers: Build applications and systems, and maintain them over time.
        - Quality assurance emgineer: designing, executing and monitoring test plans to endure quality of software products
        - Project Manager: Planning everything from execution to delivery

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Answers: IDEs provide a comprehensive platform to write, edit, compile and testcode all within a single interface and VCS effectively tracks changes made tocode over time, enabing
         seamless coolaboration between developer facilitating project progress tarcking and allowing easy recovery from errors.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Answer: They face challenges like fast changing technology and debugging complex code. They can have frequent workshops to keep up with the changes in time,


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Answer: Prompt engineering is the orocess of writing intructions to get the best results from AI


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
